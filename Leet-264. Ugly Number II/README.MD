## Description

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 
For example, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12` is the sequence of the first *10* ugly numbers.

Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number, and n does not exceed 1690.

*** 

## Approach
We know that the first ugly number is `1`.
The following ugly number are generated by min(2 * ugly[i2], 3 * ugly[i3], 5 * ugly[i5])`, which initially, `i2 = i3 = i5 = 0`.
e.g.: the 2nd ugly number 2, so increase i2 by 1 -> `i2++`, then do the same thing until there are n ugly numbers
