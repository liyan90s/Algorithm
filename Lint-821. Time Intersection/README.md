Give two users' ordered online time series, and each section records the user's login time point x and offline time point y. Find out the time periods when both users are online at the same time, and output in ascending order.

 Notice
We guarantee that the length of online time series meet 1 <= len <= 1e6.
For a user's online time series, any two of its sections do not intersect.

**Example**
```java
Given `seqA = [[1,2],[5,100]]`, `seqB = [[1,6]]`, return `[[1,2],[5,6]]`.

Explanation:
In these two time periods `[1,2]`,`[5,6]`, both users are online at the same time.
```

Given `seqA = [[1,2],[10,15]]`, `seqB = [[3,5],[7,9]]`, return `[]`.
```java
Explanation:
There is no time period, both users are online at the same time.
