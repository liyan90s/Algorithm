## Sortings
#### Quick Sort
* Time: `O(nlogn)` in average, worst case is `O(n^2)` when all the elements are nearly **sorted**
* Extra Space: `O(1)` -> in place

#### Merge Sort
* Time: `O(nlogn)` both in average and worst case
* Extra Space: `O(n)` for the extra `temp` array for merging

#### Heap Sort
