### Description
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

**Example:**
```java
Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]

The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
```

**Note:**
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.


### Approach
The main idea is based on greedy. Letâ€™s say the range of the current jump is `[curBegin, curEnd]`, `furthest` is the furthest point that all points in [curBegin, curEnd] can reach. Once the current point reaches `curEnd`, then trigger another jump, and set the new curEnd with furthest, then keep the above steps.
